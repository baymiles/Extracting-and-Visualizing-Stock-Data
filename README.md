# LS Recommendation System

## Overview
The LS Recommendation System is an advanced recommendation engine that integrates collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning techniques. Designed for handling large-scale datasets, this system is built using a combination of Python, Scala, and Java, leveraging modern tools like Spark, Hadoop, and TensorFlow for processing and model training.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:** Supports API and database extraction, data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training:** Implements collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning models with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Serving:** Deploys models as microservices with autoscaling and performance monitoring.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Processes user interactions and feedback in real-time using an event bus.
- **DevOps Integration:** Includes CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for deployment.
